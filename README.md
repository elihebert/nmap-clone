# NetScan - High-Performance Network Scanner

A modern, performance-enhanced network scanner inspired by Nmap, built with Python for speed, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Features

### Core Scanning Capabilities
- **TCP Scanning**: SYN, Connect, ACK, Window, Maimon, NULL, FIN, XMAS scans
- **UDP Scanning**: Standard UDP port scanning with optimized timing
- **ICMP Scanning**: Ping sweeps, timestamp, netmask requests
- **Service Detection**: Advanced version detection and fingerprinting
- **OS Detection**: Operating system fingerprinting using TCP/IP stack analysis
- **Script Engine**: Extensible scripting system for custom scans
- **IPv6 Support**: Full IPv6 scanning capabilities

### Performance Enhancements
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Leverages asyncio for massive parallelization
- **Adaptive Timing**: Dynamic timing adjustment based on network conditions
- **Multi-threading**: CPU-bound operations distributed across cores
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient memory usage for large-scale scans
- **Smart Retransmission**: Intelligent probe retransmission algorithms
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects target rate limits while maximizing speed

### Modern Features
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time scanning dashboard with interactive visualizations
- **REST API**: Full-featured API for integration and automation
- **Export Formats**: JSON, XML, CSV, HTML reports
- **Network Topology**: Visual network mapping and topology discovery
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Integration with CVE databases
- **Machine Learning**: ML-based service identification and anomaly detection

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elihebert/netscan.git
cd netscan

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup
python setup.py install
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic TCP SYN scan
netscan -sS 192.168.1.0/24

# Comprehensive scan with OS detection
netscan -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# UDP scan with service detection
netscan -sU -sV -p 1-1000 target.com

# Fast scan of top ports
netscan -F --top-ports 100 192.168.1.1

# Stealth scan with decoy addresses
netscan -sS -D RND:10 target.com
```

### Web Interface

```bash
# Start the web dashboard
netscan --web-ui

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

### Python API

```python
from netscan import Scanner

# Create scanner instance
scanner = Scanner()

# Perform SYN scan
results = scanner.syn_scan('192.168.1.1', ports=[80, 443, 22])

# Advanced scan with options
results = scanner.scan(
    targets=['192.168.1.0/24'],
    scan_type='syn',
    ports='1-65535',
    timing='aggressive',
    os_detection=True,
    service_detection=True
)
```
